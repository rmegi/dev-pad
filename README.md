# DevPad 

DevPad is a lightweight, frontend-only developer notebook inspired by Notepad++. It’s built for saving, organizing, and quickly copying code snippets, notes, and ideas no backend, no accounts, no friction.

Everything lives locally in your browser, so it’s fast, private, and always available.


## Tech Stack

- **React** (with TypeScript)
- **Vite** for development & build

## Getting Started

## Philosophy

DevPad is intentionally **simple**:

- No backend
- No authentication
- No sync (yet)

It’s meant to be your **personal scratchpad for code**, not another heavy editor.
